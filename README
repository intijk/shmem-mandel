Dependencies
---
#glib2      

 * For parsing configuration file. 
 * Check if you have glib.h 
	
#opencv     

 * For image generation.
 * Check if you have highgui.h

#OpenSHMEM 
 
 * Check if you have command 'oshcc' and 'oshrun'

Compile
---
Compile this by 
 $make 

Run
---
Before run, you may want to check mandelbrot.conf to set the configuration.
This will essentially effect the running time and runing result of program.
The [Area] section is to define the intresting area you want to generate.
[ImageSize] defined the final resolution of image, if you are running this
code on your laptop, better to change image size to 800x800 to check the 
result rather than stuck on a huge 8000x8000 image.  

To run this code, command below:

$ oshrun -np $NPES m 

will give you output.png as the default output. There are 3 options you 
could use in this program.

-d             When give this option, program will output debug information.
-c FILENAME    Indicate FILENAME as the configuration file. 
-o OUTPUT      Indicate OUTPUT as the output filename. Yes, extension will
               affect the final output format of image. For example: 
               '-o output.png' will give you PNG file while '-o output.jpg'
               will get JPEG file.
